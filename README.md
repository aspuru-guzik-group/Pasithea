# Pasithea

This repository contains code for Pasithea, a gradient-based method for property optimization on molecules. At the core of model is a simple fully-connected neural network. Integral to the model are the following additional components:
* SELFIES, a 100% valid representation of molecular graphs
* We also add random noise to molecular inputs. Every zero in the one-hot encoding is replaced with a random decimal in the range [0, k], where k is a specified upperbound.

At a high-level, there are two main steps:
1. Train the neural network on one-hot encoded SELFIES inputs and continuous logP outputs.
2. Inverse-train the neural network. Given a single logP and a single molecule, the network generates molecular variants that are optimized toward the logP value. The weights and biases remain fixed.
